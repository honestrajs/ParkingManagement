### Navigation Flow
```
Login → ListScreen → Main (Tab Navigator)
                ↓
            (if count > 1)
        Bike Stand Selection
                ↓
            (if count = 1)
        Direct to Main App
```

## Database Structure

- `BikeEntries/{bikeStandId}/{entryId}` - Bike parking entries
- `Managers/{managerId}` - Manager authentication
- `Employees/{employeeId}` - Employee management
- `CashEntries/{entryId}` - Cash transactions
